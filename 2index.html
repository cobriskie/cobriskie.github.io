            The Last Supper by Leonardo Da Vinci is my favorite painting due to its beauty and significance in Catholicism. I would love to visit Santa Marie Delle Grazie where the painting is located today. Italy is a dream destination of mine so going to see this work of art is the perfect excuse.
